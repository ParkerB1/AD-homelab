# Prerequisites
Below are the prerequisites needed that I used to setup this project:

Download VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
Download Windows Server 2022 ISO image: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2022
Download Windows 11 Pro ISO image: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11
I needed a product key for the client VMs. I used this generic key: VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T


Once I had all of that done, I was able to begin creating the VMs for the project.
